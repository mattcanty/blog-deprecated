# Whinge

Its a bit of a whinge this time everyone. Mid to late March didn’t quite pan out
the way I intended to say the least…

On Tuesday night following a particularly heavy weekend in Lancaster – you all
know who you are! – my bike **wheels** were stolen. It was a right bummer that 
day, all the training I had planned ruined. Made it much harder to reach the gym
for some reason too, who wants to get off a bus?…

So there they weren’t anymore, and off to the shop it went. All seemed good when
they rang me. Wheels were replaced and it wasn’t going to be the biggest loss of
wallet girth. But then they rang back and informed me that the frame was buckled
slightly – rendering it scrap. So then I started thinking well this is all
getting a bit shit isn’t it!

When I got the shop I asked something along the lines of
`((£wheels + £frame) > £newBike ?)` and they said `true`.

So I got a new bike.

# You Gadda be Kiddin Me!

So yes I got a new bike, and flippin’ heck it was quick. And this time no 
chances were being taken locking it up. D-Locked to the wall, nice thick cable
round the wheels, covered up and insured **immediately**. Yoga, sleep, wake-up,
WHEELS GONE AGAIN! *and saddle*.

So yeah it wasn’t a very good start really. Lost a lot of training miles 
considering I’d been in Lancaster the weekend before it all happened.

# Pain – it goes on…

I seem to have got myself some dull knee pain, the best I can self diagnose is
[Chondromalacia Patellae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondromalacia_patellae).
Probably due to pushing too far too soon with a big ride after all that time off
– also partying all night probably didn’t help either, more about that in a
moment.

I’ve bought myself a knee strap based on multiple sources of information across
the internet, but won’t be hanging all my hopes on it. I have my first ever
century next Sunday, and I’d rather not have to pull out. My best option may
simply be to not ride until next Saturday, do 30 miles prep and perhaps select
the 100km – instead of miles – route instead. **If anyone has any good advice on
this please leave a comment.**

# Cheer Up

I could hardly leave on such a bleak set of thoughts. So here’s what is good. I
have a bike now and here it is!

Also last Saturday night was the epic party of Jan & Ann! The Musical… . It was
Guilty Pleasures at Koko with the theme of Musical Theatre and everyone turned
out reet good. I went as a convincing scarecrow with real straw for straw. It 
was [like this](http://www.guiltypleasures.co.uk/photos?album=1&gallery=81).

Also seen Sweeney Todd, Shrek the Musical and Noises Off all of which were
brilliant. Noises Off is especially recommended by me.

# All right yeah bye
