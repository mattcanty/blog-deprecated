**Edit: Hey ho, this is a bit sad. Having moved my blog from WordPress to
Blogger and subsequently back again it seems I have lost all of these
photographs. I’ll leave the post up, but there may be some strange continuity
errors – and no photos…**

I still don’t really believe that I’m of in the morning on this crazy challenge.
Hopefully all is now set – got my packing lists, and just a few more key
ingredients need to be purchased. Then to the train and good-bye comfort for 9 
days! Here’s to good weather as I haven’t managed to get the all important
water-proof shoe covers.

But here below is definitely a picture of the bike I will be riding, with all
the extra bits I’ll be needing to get me there. More details below – scroll
scroll!

# Ta’ Like Loads

Hugest thank-you to all of you donating to the cause. Really can’t believe how
far it has now come. Just broken through the £2000 barrier today, and I have yet
more cash ready to whack up there pronto. Fully aware of a few people out there 
who still intend to donate and I look forward to it. Here is the link.

# What Gear?

So what about all the gear, shurly you musht need shome schweet gear?? Well ‘ere
it is!

* Shoes with SPD cleats, seemed like a comfortable fit and were on offer so
snapped ‘em up. Worked out really well so far – can’t fault them.
* Summer and winter gloves. I know the weather has just gone pretty marvellous
but there’s not much to stop it reverting, especially in the tops of Scotland.
* A helmet. Just a helmet. Protect your head.
* Two 500ml water bottles. I tend to have a bottle of water and a bottle of
whatever energy supplement is on offer.
* Glasses with range of lenses for differing light levels. Not actually used
these on the road yet, but going out for a ride last Saturday five small
creatures met their maker through my eye balls.
* Big saddle bag for putting lots of things in. Flapjacks mainly.
* The dreaded repair kit. Taking bets now for how many punctures I get! Don’t
worry though, I am a practical lad.
* Finally the Garmin. Recording every bump and turn. I’ll be sure to publish
each and every ride as soon as I get back. That means completing the whole thing
of course! I’m using Strava to manage my rides at the moment and it extracts a
lot of interesting data.

So there it all is. I’m off in the morning and I start riding on Sunday! No
internet for over a week – that’s the real challenge.

BYE!!!
