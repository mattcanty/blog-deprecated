# Quick Facts

* 3 x road-kill – Badger, Deer and Peacock!
* Rode for a while with two chaps – Martin and Simon if you’re out there – who,
just before I arrived were talking about how MENTAL you’d have to be to do the
Lands End 2 John O’Groats ride…
* Ate a lot of brie.
* The morning was terry-frickingly cold, literally chattering on the starting
line.
* Total time, 8 hours 19 minutes / Actual riding time 7 hours 30 minutes.
* Got lost once, resulting in a 6 mile extra which at the time was not really
what I wanted.
* Lots of fields out there.
* My knees now hurt, doctors tomorrow, need my bike fitting checking, no riding
for at least a week! Got to recover before building up some steam for the Le2Jog
challenge.

So there it is, there isn’t a terrible lot to say unless I was to go into detail
about each crank of the crank – but that would get tedious. Basically just rode
and rode, but didn’t seem like forever really. Great laugh and glad I did it.
Will be doing the Castle 100 I hope in a few weeks time to make sure I’m ready
for the biggie.
