Weheyahoy! Dear Joy has been providing the net with whole bunch of audio and
visual pleasures the last few weeks. Why don’t I compile them all here for you…
There is the release of Cartoon Song online, the fantastic Cartoon Song video
starring myself and Jane, the About A Kite live video AND the Dear Joy EP launch
tomorrow night! Here are the videos…

We’ve done a lot of rehearsing over the last few weeks and it’s sounding really
tight now. Got tomorrow night at The Old Queens Head, Thursday night at *The Bus
Drivers Prayer* (Brick Lane or summat) and we’re on *Upstairs at Ronnie Scott’s*
next Tuesday. Cannae wait!
