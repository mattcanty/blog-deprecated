Like web 2.0, only not like web 2.0.

We – Jane and I – have moved into our new flat today. This is the first time we
will co-exist exclusively with each other.

Hopefully we will enjoy your company over the next few years – Jane will make
you a nice cup of tea (of course we’ll need a kettle before she can do that (and
tea bags (oh yeah, almost forgot about tea bags (going to need some milk too,
and cups (we’ve got cups!))))).

Apologies for the nested brackets. Got carried away.

See you soon,
Matt & Jane
