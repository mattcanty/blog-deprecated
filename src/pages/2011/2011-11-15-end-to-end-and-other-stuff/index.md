Hello. How are you? I’m fine, thanks for asking.

Glad that’s done.

Well first things first – I’ve gone and applied for something mental, but many
people have already done it so its not that mental. I am taking part in the End
2 End challenge for Action Medical Research. Its a 1000 mile bike ride over 10 
days from Lands End to John o’ Groats – do the math.

Obviously I’m going to need lots of support – both financialy for the charity,
and encouragement for the preparation. I’m not expecting a flood of donations
right now as I don’t intend to promote until after Christmas. Although if you do
feel you would like to donate now, please do!

As well as taking part in the challenge, I intend to record all the data I
collect from training from my cycle computer (when I get one). I haven’t got
exact plans but I’m sure there will be Google Graphs and some other such
exciting things. I suppose it will provide many writing opportunities too.

Quick run of facts then –

* 1000 miles, 10 days.
* For Action Medical Research – http://www.action.org.uk/
* Land’s End to John o’ Groats by bike.
* Here is the Event Page – http://www.ukend2end.com/event.php

It took me a long time to write that for some reason. A very important note for all my friends is that the half-way point is in fact LANCASTER! How good is that. Fingers crossed we may be able to have a pint in The Lion that evening.

Time for a video break?

Excited about this? I know I most certainly am. It looks like a remake of San
Andreas but I certainly can’t complain about that – being one of the greatest
free roaming games ever created. The graphics look like they’re going back to a
previous GTA style unlike the ridiculous GTA 4 video requirements which blew up
one of my computers. My plan is to get a PS3 especially for this game. Thom
Bleasdale and Nick Latham, I will meet you on the battlefields – and hopefully
others!

So yeah sorry, not much else to write about. Been to see Death and The Maiden
(not good), The Woman in Black (scary!), Backbeat (brilliant) and Matilda
(AMAZING).

Tired now, works a funny old thing init.

Bye
